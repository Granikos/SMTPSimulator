# SMTP Simulator

SMTP Simulator is a SMTP service for testing inbound and outbound mailflow.

The SMTP Simulator service helps to test any SMTP based MTA (e.g. Exchange Server) and its related add-ons (e.g. anti-virus, anti-spam, etc.)

This is even more helpful when testing in a closed lab environment without any connection to an external MTA.

# Requirements
The deployment itself is currently a partial manual deployment. I am looking for some volunteer action to have this fully automated.

## Manual installs
* SQL Server Compact 4.0, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17876
* Manual Website Setup, as described in the SMTPSimulator Wiki
