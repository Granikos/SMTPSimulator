# SMTP Simulator

SMTP Simulator is a SMTP service for testing inbound and outbound mailflow.

The SMTP Simulator service helps to test any SMTP based MTA (e.g. Exchange Server) and its related add-ons (e.g. anti-virus, anti-spam, etc.)

This is even more helpful when testing in a closed lab environment without any connection to an external MTA.
