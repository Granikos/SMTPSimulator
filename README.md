# Nikos Two

Nikos Two is SMTP service for testing inbound and outbound mailflow.

The Nikos Two service helps to test any SMTP based MTA (e.g. Exchange Server) and its related add-ons (e.g. anti-virus, anti-spam, etc.)

This is even more helpful when testing in a closed lab environment without any connection to an external MTA.
